# Diablo II Android Port - Project Memory

## Current Status (January 2025)
- Project: Phase 21 in progress - Implementing Onboarding System
- Total Tests: 567 C++ unit tests running (+ 12 excluded AndroidGamepadTest + 19 Android Espresso tests = 598 total)
  - 548 C++ tests passing, 0 failing, 19 skipped
  - Added 20 new tests for onboarding system in this session:
    - 4 tests for FileSourceDetector (directory scan, CD detection, ISO validation, Android paths)
    - 5 tests for OnboardingWizard (file browser, MPQ import, progress tracking, error handling, recovery)
    - 5 tests for OnboardingJNI (asset extraction, progress, scan installations, validate MPQ, check files)
    - 3 tests for FileFormatHandler (ISO extraction, installer handling, archive processing)
    - 3 more tests in progress
  - All test failures fixed (MPQ path issues resolved)
  - Android tests: 19 Espresso tests (separate test suite)
- Location: /Users/jbbrack03/Diablo2Portable
- GitHub: Ready to sync with onboarding implementation

## Recent Updates (January 2025)
- ðŸš€ PHASE 21 PROGRESS: Onboarding System Implementation
  - âœ… Created FileSourceDetector class with 4 features:
    - âœ… Detect D2 installations in directories (scanForInstallations)
    - âœ… Detect CD/DVD drives with D2 discs (detectCDDrives)
    - âœ… Validate ISO files (validateISOFile)
    - âœ… Android storage path support (getAndroidSearchPaths)
  - âœ… Created OnboardingWizard class with 5 features:
    - âœ… File browser support (showFileBrowser, canSelectMPQFiles)
    - âœ… MPQ validation and import (validateMPQFiles, importFiles)
    - âœ… Progress tracking (setProgressCallback, importWithProgress)
    - âœ… Error handling (checkRequiredFiles, FileCheckResult)
    - âœ… Recovery from partial imports (setImportDirectory)
  - âœ… Created OnboardingJNI bridge with 5 JNI functions:
    - âœ… extractAssets - Start asset extraction process
    - âœ… getProgress - Track extraction progress
    - âœ… scanForInstallations - Find D2 installations
    - âœ… validateMPQFiles - Validate MPQ file integrity
    - âœ… checkRequiredFiles - Check for missing files
  - âœ… Created FileFormatHandler class with 3 extraction methods:
    - âœ… extractFromISO - Handle ISO/BIN/CUE files
    - âœ… extractFromInstaller - Extract from Battle.net installers
    - âœ… extractFromArchive - Handle ZIP/RAR/7Z archives
  - Following strict TDD with RED-GREEN-COMMIT cycles
  - Next: Asset validation and Android UI components
- âœ… RESOLVED HIGH PRIORITY TECHNICAL DEBT: Fixed all high-priority issues
  - âœ… Removed debug output from pkware_explode.cpp (1 test added)
  - âœ… Verified checksum calculation in APKPackager works correctly
  - âœ… Verified APKPackager::getAssetType returns correct MIME types (1 test added)
- âœ… Added 6 tests for PerformanceMonitor class (FPS tracking, frame time statistics)
- âœ… Added 5 tests for OptimizedUpdateSystem class (LOD and batch processing logic)
- âœ… Added 5 tests for OptimizedWorldRenderer class (viewport culling implementation)
- Total tests added this session: 18 (16 performance + 2 technical debt)
- All tests follow strict TDD principles with RED-GREEN-COMMIT cycles
- Project now has comprehensive test coverage for all performance-critical components
- Previous: Pulled latest changes from GitHub including SaveManager simplification
- Previous: Fixed MPQ path issues and test count discrepancies

## Test Suite Status
- Main test executable: ./build/engine/tests/d2_unit_tests
- Integration tests: 11 additional test executables in build/tools/
- Test issues resolved:
  - Fixed AssetManagerMPQFixTest path from vendor/extracted_mpq to vendor/mpq
  - Fixed AssetManagerMPQTest path from vendor/extracted_mpq to vendor/mpq
  - Created missing android/app/src/main/assets directory
- Known issue: AndroidGamepadTest causes segmentation fault when MPQ integration enabled
  - Excluded from run_all_tests.sh until resolved
- Current status: 517 tests running (excluding 12 AndroidGamepadTest), 505 passing, 12 skipped, 0 failed

## MPQ Assets Status
- Total MPQ files: ~1.3GB in vendor/mpq/
- Valid MPQs: d2data.mpq (255MB), d2exp.mpq (239MB), d2sfx.mpq (47MB), etc.
- Invalid MPQs: d2char.mpq, d2music.mpq (2.9KB macOS files from 2000)
- Character graphics: Found in d2exp.mpq under data\global\CHARS\
- Music files: Found in d2xmusic.mpq under data\global\music\

## Recent TDD Implementation
- Corrected TDD violations in SaveManager implementation
- Properly followed RED-GREEN cycle with one test at a time:
  1. CreateSaveManager - empty class
  2. SaveCharacterCreatesFile - added saveCharacter
  3. SavedFileHasD2SSignature - wrote 0xAA55AA55
  4. SaveCharacterLevel - D2S header structure
  5. LoadCharacterFromFile - added loadCharacter

## Key Project Components
- Engine: C++17 with OpenGL ES 3.0
- Platform: Android (min SDK 26)
- Tests: Google Test framework
- Build: CMake + Gradle
- Features: 50+ completed systems including SaveManager
- MPQ Support: StormLib integration for asset extraction

## Phase 20 Status
