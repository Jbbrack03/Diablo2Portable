## üö® **PROJECT STATUS UPDATE (January 2025)**

**PROJECT STATUS: ALL PHASES 0-40 COMPLETE + CRITICAL ASSET LOADING FIX - TRULY PRODUCTION READY! üéâ**

**ACTUAL STATUS**: Truly production-ready Android app with 843 comprehensive tests (825 passing, 18 skipping gracefully, 0 failing). Complete OpenGL pipeline, comprehensive asset extraction system, fully integrated asset loading pipeline, enhanced asset validation with integrity checking, functional JNI bridge for Android integration, and comprehensive development guidance. ALL 40 PHASES COMPLETE + PRODUCTION ENHANCEMENTS APPLIED!

## Project Overview

This is a Diablo II Android port project targeting the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 device. The project aims to create a native ARM implementation without emulation, featuring full controller support and modern UI improvements while maintaining LAN multiplayer compatibility.

**Current Reality**: Truly production-ready implementation with 843 comprehensive tests (825 passing, 18 skipping gracefully, 0 failing). The Android app can create a game engine, process input, perform full OpenGL rendering with all features implemented (shaders, textures, VBOs, draw commands), and most critically - load extracted MPQ assets from the onboarding system. All 40 phases of the TDD Implementation Plan are complete, with all systems validated for production deployment and critical integration issues resolved.

## Build Commands

### Initial Setup (Current - Framework Complete)
```bash
# NOTE: All core systems validated and functional via comprehensive testing
# MPQ asset loading requires real Diablo II game files (not included due to copyright)

# Step 1: Copy your legally owned D2 files
cp /path/to/diablo2/*.mpq vendor/mpq/
# Required files: d2data.mpq, d2exp.mpq, d2sfx.mpq, d2music.mpq, etc.

# Step 2: Set up development environment
./tools/setup_environment.sh

# Step 3: Build the C++ engine (desktop/testing)
cmake -B build
cmake --build build

# Step 4: Run tests
./run_all_tests.sh
```

### Android Development Setup
```bash
# Set up Android development environment (requires Android Studio)
export ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/your/android-ndk
./tools/setup_environment.sh

# Build Android project
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Deploy to connected device
./gradlew installDebug
# OR use the deployment script:
../tools/deploy_to_device.sh
```

### Testing with Real Game Files
The project includes real Diablo II MPQ files in `vendor/mpq/` for integration testing:
- d2data.mpq, d2exp.mpq, d2sfx.mpq, etc. (lowercase naming)
- Run `./run_all_tests.sh` to execute all 843 tests including MPQ integration tests
- ‚úÖ **CURRENT STATUS**: 843 tests total (825 passing, 18 skipping gracefully, 0 failing) - 100% success rate

## Architecture

The project follows a native Android implementation approach with these key components:

1. **Core Engine** (C++17)
   - Located in `engine/src/`
   - Game logic, rendering, input handling
   - Uses OpenGL ES 3.0 for graphics
   - Custom MPQ loader for asset extraction

2. **Android Framework** (Kotlin/Java)
   - Located in `android/app/src/`
   - JNI bridge to native engine
   - Android-specific UI and lifecycle management
   - Gamepad integration with controller support

3. **Asset Pipeline**
   - MPQ extraction tools in `tools/mpq_extractor/`
   - Sprite optimization for mobile GPUs
   - UI asset modification system

4. **Test Framework**
   - Google Test for C++ unit tests
   - Espresso for Android UI tests
   - Test-Driven Development approach per TDD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

## Development Priorities

1. **Controller Support**: Primary input method via Xbox-style gamepad
2. **Performance**: Target 60 FPS on Snapdragon processors
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Under 1.5GB RAM usage
4. **Battery Life**: 4+ hours gameplay target
5. **LAN Compatibility**: Maintain protocol compatibility with PC version

## Key Technical Standards

- **C++ Standard**: C++17
- **Android Min SDK**: 26 (Android 8.0)
- **Android Target SDK**: 33 (Android 13)
- **Graphics API**: OpenGL ES 3.0
- **Audio**: Oboe library
- **Build Tools**: CMake 3.22.1 + Gradle
- **NDK Version**: r25c or newer

## Testing Requirements

- Maintain 90%+ test coverage
- All new features require tests first (TDD)
- Run full test suite before commits
- Test on physical Retroid Pocket Flip 2 device when possible

## Critical Development Guidelines

### Test-Driven Development (MANDATORY - STRICTLY ENFORCED)

**ABSOLUTE RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

## MANDATORY TDD CHECKPOINT QUESTIONS

### Before Writing Tests:

1. ‚ùì **"Have I reviewed existing code architecture and interfaces?"**
2. ‚ùì **"Do I understand the current data structures and types?"**
3. ‚ùì **"Am I testing against the ACTUAL system, not my assumptions?"**

### Before Writing Implementation:

1. ‚ùì **"Have I written exactly ONE failing test?"**
2. ‚ùì **"Have I seen that ONE test fail?"**
3. ‚ùì **"Am I about to implement ONLY what makes that ONE test pass?"**
4. ‚ùì **"Will I commit immediately after this test passes?"**

**If ANY answer is "no" - STOP and course-correct.**

## ENFORCED TDD WORKFLOW

**NEVER deviate from this sequence:**

1. **REVIEW existing code** - Understand interfaces, types, and architecture
2. **Write ONE test** (and only one) that matches ACTUAL system structure
3. **Run**: `cmake --build build && ./build/engine/tests/d2_unit_tests`
4. **Verify failure** (must see test failure)
5. **Implement minimal code** (only what makes THIS test pass)
6. **Run same command**, verify pass
7. **Commit** with message: "Add [feature] support - RED/GREEN cycle complete"
8. **ONLY THEN** proceed to next test

**CRITICAL**: Each test is a complete story that deserves individual attention, not a step in a batch process.

## CORE TDD RULES

1. **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR ONLY**

   - RED: Write a failing test FIRST (test must fail)
   - GREEN: Write MINIMAL code to make test pass
   - REFACTOR: Clean up code while keeping tests green
   - **VIOLATION**: Writing ANY implementation code before a failing test

2. **TEST IMMUTABILITY**

   - Tests are CONTRACTS - once written, they CANNOT be changed
   - If a test seems wrong, the implementation is wrong, NOT the test
   - **VIOLATION**: Modifying any test to make implementation pass
   - **EXCEPTION**: Only if requirements genuinely changed (must document why)

3. **NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT TESTS**

   - Every line of implementation code MUST have a corresponding test
   - No "temporary" code without tests
   - No "quick fixes" without tests
   - **VIOLATION**: Any implementation code not covered by tests

4. **SINGLE TEST DISCIPLINE**
   - Write exactly ONE test at a time
   - See it fail before writing ANY implementation
   - Implement ONLY what makes that ONE test pass
   - Commit before writing the next test
   - **VIOLATION**: Writing multiple tests before implementing any

## TDD VIOLATIONS TO AVOID

- ‚ùå Writing implementation then tests
- ‚ùå Modifying tests to match implementation
- ‚ùå Skipping tests for "simple" code
- ‚ùå **Writing multiple tests before implementing any**
- ‚ùå **Batching RED-GREEN cycles without commits**
- ‚ùå Commenting out failing tests
- ‚ùå Writing tests that always pass
- ‚ùå **Writing tests without understanding existing architecture**
- ‚ùå **Testing against assumed interfaces instead of actual ones**

## CORRECT TDD EXAMPLE

```cpp
// STEP 0: Review existing MPQ system structure
// Check: engine/include/utils/mpq_loader.h shows extractFile method signature

// STEP 1: Write exactly ONE failing test
TEST_F(MPQLoaderTest, ExtractZlibCompressedFile) {
    createZlibCompressedTestMPQ();
    
    ASSERT_TRUE(loader.open(zlib_compressed_mpq_path.string()));
    
    std::vector<uint8_t> output;
    EXPECT_TRUE(loader.extractFile("compressed_data.txt", output)); // This MUST fail first
    
    std::string content(output.begin(), output.end());
    EXPECT_EQ(content, "This is test content that will be compressed using zlib!");
}

// STEP 2: Run cmake --build build && ./build/engine/tests/d2_unit_tests, see failure
// STEP 3: Write minimal implementation (add compression support)
// STEP 4: Test passes
// STEP 5: Commit immediately
// STEP 6: ONLY THEN write next test
```

## DISCIPLINE ENFORCEMENT

**Think of each test as a discipline exercise, not an efficiency optimization.**

- Each RED-GREEN cycle builds muscle memory
- Batching cycles breaks the discipline
- The goal is internalization, not speed

## Technical Notes

### Namespace Organization
The project uses two namespace conventions:
- **`namespace d2`** - Used for most game engine components (game, ui, rendering, etc.)
- **`namespace d2portable`** - Used for utility components (utils, sprites, core)
- A wrapper header (`engine/include/utils/mpq_loader.h`) provides compatibility between namespaces

### Asset Pipeline Implementation
The asset pipeline tools for mobile optimization:
- **AssetExtractor** - Extracts DC6 sprites, sounds, and data from D2 MPQ files
- **AssetOptimizer** - Compresses sprites for mobile devices
- **TextureAtlasGenerator** - Packs sprites into texture atlases
- **ISOExtractor** - Extracts files from ISO images
- **PatchSystem** - Handles patch detection and application

## Important Notes

- This is a clean-room implementation - no original Diablo II code
- Users must provide their own legally purchased game files
- Project is for personal use only, not for distribution
- Refer to comprehensive documentation in `Docs/` directory for detailed implementation guides
- Historical development details archived in `CLAUDE_ARCHIVE.md`

## File References

When referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.

## Development Process Notes

- Follow TDD practices - write tests first, then implementation (red green cycle)
- Make incremental progress on existing features or start new ones
- Ensure all changes align with the project architecture, requirements, and best practices
- Review existing codebase before writing failing tests
- Create clean, simple code whenever possible
- Do not implement in a way that breaks the codebase
