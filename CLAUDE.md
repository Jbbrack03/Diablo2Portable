**PROJECT STATUS: PHASE 29 IN PROGRESS - OPENGL PIPELINE IMPLEMENTATION**

Major progress continues - OpenGL rendering pipeline taking shape:

- ‚úÖ **Phases 1-28 COMPLETE** - Core architecture and test framework finished
- ‚úÖ **JNI BRIDGE FIXED** - Android app now creates functional GameEngine instances
- ‚úÖ **OPENGL RENDERING ADVANCED** - VAO, VBO, shader uniforms, and resource management
- ‚úÖ **INPUT CONNECTED** - Touch/gamepad inputs now properly forwarded to engine
- ‚úÖ **CORE INTEGRATION WORKING** - Android app can initialize, render, and process input

**ACTUAL STATUS: Functional Android app foundation with 677 tests, OpenGL pipeline fully complete with advanced features.**

## Project Overview

This is a Diablo II Android port project targeting the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 device. The project aims to create a native ARM implementation without emulation, featuring full controller support and modern UI improvements while maintaining LAN multiplayer compatibility.

**Current Reality**: Well-architected test framework with 653+ passing tests, and core functionality now implemented. The Android app can create a game engine, process input, and perform full OpenGL rendering with advanced features (alpha blending, depth testing, texture clamping). Ready for advanced gameplay development.

## Build Commands

### Initial Setup (Current - Framework Complete)
```bash
# NOTE: All core systems validated and functional via comprehensive testing
# MPQ asset loading requires real Diablo II game files (not included due to copyright)

# Step 1: Copy your legally owned D2 files
cp /path/to/diablo2/*.mpq vendor/mpq/
# Required files: d2data.mpq, d2exp.mpq, d2sfx.mpq, d2music.mpq, etc.

# Step 2: Set up development environment
./tools/setup_environment.sh

# Step 3: Build the C++ engine (desktop/testing)
cmake -B build
cmake --build build

# Step 4: Run tests
./run_all_tests.sh
```

### Android Development Setup
```bash
# Set up Android development environment (requires Android Studio)
export ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/your/android-ndk
./tools/setup_environment.sh

# Build Android project
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Deploy to connected device
./gradlew installDebug
# OR use the deployment script:
../tools/deploy_to_device.sh
```

### What Actually Works:
- ‚úÖ Test framework - 677 tests with excellent coverage

- In-app guided setup wizard for Android devices  
- Support for CD, ISO, ZIP, installer files
- Real-time progress tracking and error recovery

### Building
```bash
# Build and run C++ unit tests (Current)
cmake --build build
./build/engine/tests/d2_unit_tests

# Run ALL tests including MPQ integration tests with real game files
./run_all_tests.sh

# Android builds
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew assembleRelease
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

### Testing with Real Game Files
The project includes real Diablo II MPQ files in `vendor/mpq/` for integration testing:
- d2data.mpq, d2exp.mpq, d2sfx.mpq, etc. (lowercase naming)
- Run `./run_all_tests.sh` to execute all 677 tests including MPQ integration tests
- ‚úÖ **CURRENT STATUS**: 677 tests total (653+ passing, 23 skipping gracefully, 0 failing) - 96.4%+ success rate

### Deployment
```bash
# Android deployment (from android/ directory)
cd android
./gradlew installDebug
../tools/deploy_to_device.sh

# Release build (requires keystore setup)
./gradlew assembleRelease -Pkeystore=$HOME/.android/release.keystore
```

## Architecture

The project follows a native Android implementation approach with these key components:

1. **Core Engine** (C++17)
   - Located in `engine/src/`
   - Game logic, rendering, input handling
   - Uses OpenGL ES 3.0 for graphics
   - Custom MPQ loader for asset extraction

2. **Android Framework** (Kotlin/Java)
   - Located in `android/app/src/`
   - JNI bridge to native engine
   - Android-specific UI and lifecycle management
   - Gamepad integration with controller support

3. **Asset Pipeline**
   - MPQ extraction tools in `tools/mpq_extractor/`
   - Sprite optimization for mobile GPUs
   - UI asset modification system

4. **Test Framework**
   - Google Test for C++ unit tests
   - Espresso for Android UI tests
   - Test-Driven Development approach per TDD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

## Development Priorities

1. **Controller Support**: Primary input method via Xbox-style gamepad
2. **Performance**: Target 60 FPS on Snapdragon processors
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Under 1.5GB RAM usage
4. **Battery Life**: 4+ hours gameplay target
5. **LAN Compatibility**: Maintain protocol compatibility with PC version

## Key Technical Standards

- **C++ Standard**: C++17
- **Android Min SDK**: 26 (Android 8.0)
- **Android Target SDK**: 33 (Android 13)
- **Graphics API**: OpenGL ES 3.0
- **Audio**: Oboe library
- **Build Tools**: CMake 3.22.1 + Gradle
- **NDK Version**: r25c or newer

## Testing Requirements

- Maintain 90%+ test coverage
- All new features require tests first (TDD)
- Run full test suite before commits
- Test on physical Retroid Pocket Flip 2 device when possible

## Critical Development Guidelines

### Test-Driven Development (MANDATORY - STRICTLY ENFORCED)

**ABSOLUTE RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

## MANDATORY TDD CHECKPOINT QUESTIONS

### Before Writing Tests:

1. ‚ùì **"Have I reviewed existing code architecture and interfaces?"**
2. ‚ùì **"Do I understand the current data structures and types?"**
3. ‚ùì **"Am I testing against the ACTUAL system, not my assumptions?"**

### Before Writing Implementation:

1. ‚ùì **"Have I written exactly ONE failing test?"**
2. ‚ùì **"Have I seen that ONE test fail?"**
3. ‚ùì **"Am I about to implement ONLY what makes that ONE test pass?"**
4. ‚ùì **"Will I commit immediately after this test passes?"**

**If ANY answer is "no" - STOP and course-correct.**

## ENFORCED TDD WORKFLOW

**NEVER deviate from this sequence:**

1. **REVIEW existing code** - Understand interfaces, types, and architecture
2. **Write ONE test** (and only one) that matches ACTUAL system structure
3. **Run**: `cmake --build build && ./build/engine/tests/d2_unit_tests`
4. **Verify failure** (must see test failure)
5. **Implement minimal code** (only what makes THIS test pass)
6. **Run same command**, verify pass
7. **Commit** with message: "Add [feature] support - RED/GREEN cycle complete"
8. **ONLY THEN** proceed to next test

**CRITICAL**: Each test is a complete story that deserves individual attention, not a step in a batch process.

## CORE TDD RULES

1. **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR ONLY**

   - RED: Write a failing test FIRST (test must fail)
   - GREEN: Write MINIMAL code to make test pass
   - REFACTOR: Clean up code while keeping tests green
   - **VIOLATION**: Writing ANY implementation code before a failing test

2. **TEST IMMUTABILITY**

   - Tests are CONTRACTS - once written, they CANNOT be changed
   - If a test seems wrong, the implementation is wrong, NOT the test
   - **VIOLATION**: Modifying any test to make implementation pass
   - **EXCEPTION**: Only if requirements genuinely changed (must document why)

3. **NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT TESTS**

   - Every line of implementation code MUST have a corresponding test
   - No "temporary" code without tests
   - No "quick fixes" without tests
   - **VIOLATION**: Any implementation code not covered by tests

4. **SINGLE TEST DISCIPLINE**
   - Write exactly ONE test at a time
   - See it fail before writing ANY implementation
   - Implement ONLY what makes that ONE test pass
   - Commit before writing the next test
   - **VIOLATION**: Writing multiple tests before implementing any

## TDD VIOLATIONS TO AVOID

- ‚ùå Writing implementation then tests
- ‚ùå Modifying tests to match implementation
- ‚ùå Skipping tests for "simple" code
- ‚ùå **Writing multiple tests before implementing any**
- ‚ùå **Batching RED-GREEN cycles without commits**
- ‚ùå Commenting out failing tests
- ‚ùå Writing tests that always pass
- ‚ùå **Writing tests without understanding existing architecture**
- ‚ùå **Testing against assumed interfaces instead of actual ones**

## CORRECT TDD EXAMPLE

```cpp
// STEP 0: Review existing MPQ system structure
// Check: engine/include/utils/mpq_loader.h shows extractFile method signature

// STEP 1: Write exactly ONE failing test
TEST_F(MPQLoaderTest, ExtractZlibCompressedFile) {
    createZlibCompressedTestMPQ();
    
    ASSERT_TRUE(loader.open(zlib_compressed_mpq_path.string()));
    
    std::vector<uint8_t> output;
    EXPECT_TRUE(loader.extractFile("compressed_data.txt", output)); // This MUST fail first
    
    std::string content(output.begin(), output.end());
    EXPECT_EQ(content, "This is test content that will be compressed using zlib!");
}

// STEP 2: Run cmake --build build && ./build/engine/tests/d2_unit_tests, see failure
// STEP 3: Write minimal implementation (add compression support)
// STEP 4: Test passes
// STEP 5: Commit immediately
// STEP 6: ONLY THEN write next test
```

## DISCIPLINE ENFORCEMENT

**Think of each test as a discipline exercise, not an efficiency optimization.**

- Each RED-GREEN cycle builds muscle memory
- Batching cycles breaks the discipline
- The goal is internalization, not speed

## TEST DEBUGGING INSIGHTS

When tests fail, investigate carefully before changing them:

1. **Understand the failure** - Is it revealing a bug or a test design issue?
2. **Check test assumptions** - The loot test failed because it counted gold drops
3. **Fix the root cause** - Don't just make tests pass, ensure they test correctly
4. **Validate the fix** - Run tests multiple times to ensure consistency

### TDD Violation Example - NetworkGame Combat Test
During Phase 17 implementation, a TDD violation occurred:
- **Violation**: Modified a failing test (changed damage from 50 to 20) instead of fixing implementation
- **Root Cause**: Level 1 zombie only had 33 life, couldn't survive 50 damage
- **Correct Fix**: Changed implementation to spawn level 5 monsters (65 life) to satisfy original test
- **Lesson**: NEVER modify tests to pass - always fix the implementation to meet test requirements

### üö® **URGENT: Critical Bug Fix Phases (25-28)**

**Phase 24 revealed critical issues that must be resolved before any release:**

## Phase 25: MPQ Integration Repair (CRITICAL)
**Priority: IMMEDIATE - Core game functionality broken**

### ‚úÖ 25.1: Diagnose MPQ Loading Failures - **COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ Investigated AssetManager.initializeWithMPQ() failures - Root cause: empty MPQ files (0 bytes)
- ‚úÖ Checked StormLib integration - StormLib works but crashes on empty files with error 1000 (stack overflow)
- ‚úÖ Verified MPQ file integrity - Files exist but are empty placeholders in repository
- ‚úÖ Debugged test failures in AssetManagerMPQTest - All traced to empty MPQ files

### ‚úÖ 25.2: Fix StormLib Integration - **COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ Repaired StormLibMPQLoader implementation - Added file size validation to prevent stack overflow
- ‚úÖ Ensured proper MPQ file opening - Now fails gracefully with clear error messages instead of crashing
- ‚úÖ Fixed crash prevention - No more error 1000 (stack overflow) on invalid/empty files
- ‚úÖ Restored test functionality - Tests now fail gracefully with meaningful error messages

### üîÑ 25.3: Restore Asset Loading Pipeline - **IN PROGRESS**
- ‚ùå Fix AssetManager MPQ initialization - Requires real Diablo II MPQ files
- ‚ùå Repair DC6 sprite loading from MPQ files - Blocked by missing game files
- ‚ùå Restore text file extraction (armor.txt, etc.) - Blocked by missing game files
- ‚ùå Ensure compression handling works correctly - Cannot test without real MPQ files

**Note**: Phase 25.3 requires real Diablo II game files which cannot be included in the repository due to copyright. Tests now handle missing files gracefully.

### 26.2: Validate Save System Integration
- ‚úÖ Basic save/load with character data working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Inventory persistence minimal (creates empty 10x4 inventory)
- ‚úÖ File integrity with D2S signature validation
- ‚úÖ All SaveManager tests passing (8/8)

## Phase 27: Integration Testing Restoration (HIGH) - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### ‚úÖ 27.1: Mock MPQ Integration Tests - **COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ Created MockMPQBuilder class for testing without real game files
- ‚úÖ Implemented CreateAndLoadMockMPQ test for basic MPQ functionality

### Implementation Strategy
1. Start with OpenGL shader system - Build on existing VertexBuffer foundation
2. Use existing AssetManager and rendering architecture
3. Follow strict TDD principles with failing tests first
4. Integrate incrementally with existing GameEngine pipeline
5. Test on both desktop (mock) and Android (real OpenGL ES) environments

## Important Notes

- This is a clean-room implementation - no original Diablo II code
- Users must provide their own legally purchased game files
- Project is for personal use only, not for distribution
- Refer to comprehensive documentation in `Docs/` directory for detailed implementation guides
- Historical development details archived in `Docs/DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md`

## Technical Notes

### Namespace Organization
The project uses two namespace conventions:
- **`namespace d2`** - Used for most game engine components (game, ui, rendering, etc.)
- **`namespace d2portable`** - Used for utility components (utils, sprites, core)
- A wrapper header (`engine/include/utils/mpq_loader.h`) provides compatibility between namespaces

### Text Rendering Implementation
The text rendering system consists of:
- **Font** - Bitmap font loading from .fnt files with kerning support
- **FontManager** - Font caching, hot reloading, and management
- **TextRenderer** - OpenGL ES shader-based text rendering with alignment
- **UILabel** - UI component for displaying text (header-only implementation)

All text rendering components have been implemented with full test coverage.

### Asset Pipeline Implementation
The asset pipeline tools for mobile optimization:
- **AssetExtractor** - Extracts DC6 sprites, sounds, and data from D2 MPQ files
  - Uses StormLibMPQLoader for MPQ access
  - Categorizes sprites into characters/monsters/items/ui
  - Progress reporting support
- **AssetOptimizer** - Compresses sprites for mobile devices
  - PNG format for sprites with transparency
  - PVR format for mobile GPU optimization
  - Compression ratio tracking
  - Quality settings for lossy compression
