# Implementation Discrepancies Report

This document identifies discrepancies between what CLAUDE.md claims as "COMPLETE" and the actual implementation state.

## 1. SaveManager Inventory Persistence (INCOMPLETE)

**Claim**: "✅ Save/Load System - D2S format, checksum validation, inventory persistence"

**Reality**: 
- The `saveCharacterWithInventory` method is a **stub** that ignores inventory data
- Only saves character data, not inventory items
- `loadCharacterWithInventory` returns an empty 10x4 inventory grid
- No actual inventory item persistence implemented

```cpp
// engine/src/save/save_manager.cpp line 131-133
bool SaveManager::saveCharacterWithInventory(const d2::game::Character& character, 
                                           const d2::game::Inventory& inventory,
                                           const std::string& filename) {
    // For now, just save the character (minimal implementation to pass test)
    // TODO: Add inventory data to save file format
    return saveCharacter(character, filename);
}
```

## 2. Android Gamepad Input (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

**Claim**: "✅ Gamepad Input - Full controller support with mapping"

**Reality**:
- MainActivity has TODO comments for gamepad handling
- NativeEngine class has no gamepad input methods
- JNI bridge (jni_bridge.cpp) contains only placeholders
- No actual gamepad input forwarding to the game engine

```java
// MainActivity.java lines 67-68
if (nativeEngine != null) {
    // TODO: Implement native gamepad handling
    return true;
}
```

```java
// MainActivity.java lines 120-121
// TODO: Forward to native engine
// nativeEngine.onGamepadInput(x, y, rx, ry, lt, rt);
```

## 3. JNI Bridge (PLACEHOLDER ONLY)

**Claim**: Multiple features marked as complete that depend on JNI bridge

**Reality**:
- jni_bridge.cpp returns null for engine creation
- All methods are placeholders with no actual implementation
- Engine is never actually created or initialized

```cpp
// jni_bridge.cpp lines 10-14
JNIEXPORT jlong JNICALL
Java_com_diablo2portable_NativeEngine_createEngine(JNIEnv* env, jobject /* this */) {
    LOGD("Creating engine instance");
    // Placeholder - would create actual engine instance
    return reinterpret_cast<jlong>(nullptr);
}
```

## 4. Asset Validation (MINIMAL STUB)

**Claim**: "✅ Asset Validator - Validate extracted assets, detect missing files, generate checksum manifests"

**Reality**:
- AssetValidator::validateAssets always returns true/complete
- No actual validation logic implemented
- Minimal MPQ header check only

```cpp
// asset_validator.cpp lines 10-19
AssetValidation AssetValidator::validateAssets(const std::string& assetPath) {
    AssetValidation validation;
    
    // Minimal implementation to make test pass
    validation.isComplete = true;
    validation.hasExpansion = true;
    validation.version = D2Version::CLASSIC;
    
    return validation;
}
```

## 5. GameEngine Asset Initialization (INCORRECT METHOD)

**Claim**: Integration tests pass with MPQ files

**Reality**:
- GameEngine calls `initialize(path)` instead of `initializeWithMPQs(path)`
- This means MPQ files are never actually loaded
- The AssetManager treats the path as a regular directory, not MPQ container

```cpp
// game_engine.cpp lines 40-44
if (!assetPath.empty()) {
    if (!assetManager_->initialize(assetPath)) {  // Wrong method!
        return false;
    }
}
```

## 6. Touch Input Integration (INCOMPLETE)

**Claim**: "✅ Touch Input Processing - Critical for mobile gameplay"

**Reality**:
- TouchInput class exists but is not connected to Android layer
- JNI bridge has onTouchEvent but it's a placeholder
- No actual touch events reach the game engine

## 7. Audio System (NO REAL IMPLEMENTATION)

**Claim**: "✅ Audio System Enhancement - Real audio functionality"

**Reality**:
- Tests exist but no actual audio playback implementation
- No connection to Android audio APIs
- AudioDevice class is not implemented

## Summary of Critical Issues

1. **No Working JNI Bridge**: The entire native engine is non-functional on Android
2. **No Input Handling**: Neither gamepad nor touch inputs work
3. **Wrong Asset Loading**: GameEngine doesn't use MPQ loading methods
4. **Stub Implementations**: Many "complete" features are minimal stubs to pass tests
5. **No Inventory Persistence**: Save system doesn't actually save inventory items

## Severity Assessment

- **CRITICAL**: JNI bridge placeholders mean the Android app cannot run the game at all
- **HIGH**: Input systems not connected means no way to control the game
- **HIGH**: Asset loading using wrong method means no game assets will load
- **MEDIUM**: Save system incomplete but basic character saving works
- **LOW**: Asset validation stubs (not critical for basic functionality)

## Recommendation

The project is NOT ready for deployment as claimed. Critical infrastructure components are missing or implemented as stubs. The Android app would not be able to run the game engine at all due to the placeholder JNI bridge.
