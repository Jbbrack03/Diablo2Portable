# AI Development Capabilities for Diablo II Android Port

## What I CAN Do Independently

### 1. Code Development ✅
- Write all C++/Java/Kotlin source code
- Create build configurations (CMake, Gradle)
- Implement game logic, rendering, input systems
- Write asset extraction scripts
- Create UI layouts and resources
- Debug and fix code issues

### 2. Project Structure ✅
- Create and organize all project files
- Set up proper directory structures
- Write configuration files
- Create build scripts

### 3. Documentation ✅
- Write comprehensive documentation
- Create API references
- Design specifications
- Implementation guides

## What Requires User Interaction

### 1. Visual Development Tools ❌
- **Android Studio GUI Operations**
  - Creating new project through wizard
  - Using AVD Manager to create emulators
  - Visual layout editor
  - GUI-based SDK Manager
  
  *Solution: I can provide exact step-by-step instructions or create projects via command line*

### 2. External Software Installation ❌
- **Installing Android Studio**
- **Installing Wine/CrossOver**
- **Running Windows installers**
  
  *Solution: I provide terminal commands, you execute them*

### 3. Physical Device Operations ❌
- **Connecting Android devices via USB**
- **Enabling developer mode on devices**
- **Running on actual hardware**
  
  *Solution: I provide instructions, you perform physical actions*

### 4. Account-Based Operations ❌
- **Signing APKs with certificates**
- **Google Play Console (if ever needed)**
- **License agreements**
  
  *Solution: I guide you through these processes*

### 5. Binary File Operations ⚠️
- **Extracting from CD ISO files**
- **Running Wine to install games**
- **Viewing graphical output**
  
  *Solution: I write scripts, you run them and report results*

## Development Workflow

### Fully Automated Tasks
```bash
# I can create and run these entirely:
- Source code generation
- Build script creation
- Asset conversion scripts
- Automated testing
- Code compilation (via gradle/cmake)
```

### Guided Tasks
```bash
# You'll need to run these with my instructions:
- Android Studio installation
- Wine setup
- Game installation
- Emulator creation
- Device deployment
```

## Practical Example Workflow

### What Development Looks Like:

1. **I write all code:**
```cpp
// I create complete implementation files
class D2Renderer {
    void initialize() {
        // Full implementation
    }
};
```

2. **You run installation commands:**
```bash
# I provide command, you execute:
brew install --cask android-studio
```

3. **I create build scripts:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# I write complete automation
./gradlew build
adb install app-debug.apk
```

4. **You handle GUI operations:**
- Open Android Studio
- Click "New Project"
- Select "Native C++"
- Follow my exact instructions

## Optimized Development Strategy

### 1. Maximum Automation
- Use command-line tools wherever possible
- Create scripts for repetitive tasks
- Minimize GUI interactions

### 2. Clear Instructions
- Step-by-step guides for GUI operations
- Screenshots descriptions when needed
- Exact menu paths and button names

### 3. Verification Scripts
```bash
# I create scripts to verify your actions
check_android_setup.sh
verify_game_extraction.sh
test_build_environment.sh
```

## Time Estimates

### Independent Development (I do alone): 70%
- All source code
- Build configurations  
- Scripts and automation
- Documentation

### Guided Development (You + My instructions): 30%
- Software installation
- GUI operations
- Physical device setup
- Running installers

## Bottom Line

I can develop ~70% of the project independently by:
- Writing all code and scripts
- Creating the entire project structure
- Providing command-line solutions

You'll need to:
- Run installation commands I provide
- Execute scripts I create
- Follow GUI instructions for Android Studio
- Handle physical device connections

The development is very feasible with this collaboration model. Most of the complex work (coding, architecture, algorithms) I handle completely. You mainly execute installation steps and run the builds I create.
