## Major Technical Investigations

### MPQ Compression Implementation Details (January 2025)

#### **Compression Algorithms Implemented:**
1. **Zlib (Deflate)** - Standard compression using system zlib library
2. **PKWARE DCL** - Data Compression Library "implode" algorithm
3. **Huffman** - Tree-based encoding for MPQ files
4. **Multi-compression** - Handles combined compression methods

#### **Key Implementation Files:**
- `engine/src/utils/pkware_explode.cpp` - PKWARE DCL decompression
- `engine/src/utils/huffman_decompress.cpp` - Huffman decompression
- `engine/src/utils/mpq_loader.cpp` - Updated with all compression support

#### **Compression Constants:**
```cpp
const uint8_t MPQ_COMPRESSION_HUFFMAN = 0x01;
const uint8_t MPQ_COMPRESSION_ZLIB = 0x02;
const uint8_t MPQ_COMPRESSION_PKWARE = 0x08;
```

#### **Important Notes:**
- Decompression order for multi-compression: Huffman → Zlib → PKWARE
- Table decryption uses pre-computed keys: 0xC3AF3770 (hash), 0xEC83B3A3 (block)
- File-level encryption detected but not yet implemented

### PKWARE DCL Investigation and Partial Resolution (June 2025)

#### 🎯 **Major Breakthrough: Root Cause Identified and Partially Fixed**

After extensive investigation comparing our implementation with StormLib (the proven working MPQ library), we successfully identified and partially resolved the PKWARE decompression issues.

#### **🔍 Investigation Process:**

**1. Downloaded StormLib Source Code**
- Cloned the authoritative StormLib repository by Ladislav Zezula
- Analyzed their proven working PKWARE DCL implementation in `explode.c`
- Compared their algorithm with our implementation line-by-line

**2. Critical Differences Identified**
- **Our approach**: Direct distance code → distance mapping with large lookup tables
- **StormLib approach**: Huffman decode → position code → shift and combine with extra bits
- **Our tables**: Custom 256-entry arrays with incorrect values
- **StormLib tables**: Proven 64-entry arrays from real PKWARE DCL specification

#### **🔧 Key Algorithmic Differences:**

**Distance Calculation:**
```cpp
// Our old approach (WRONG):
distance = dist_code; // Direct mapping for large codes

// StormLib approach (CORRECT):
distance = (dist_pos_code << dsize_bits) | extra_bits + 1;
```

**Bit Reading Strategy:**
- **Our approach**: Fixed bit counts based on distance ranges
- **StormLib**: Variable-length Huffman decoding with proper decode tables

**Length-Distance Dependency:**
- **Our approach**: Distance calculated independently of length
- **StormLib**: Length decoded first, then affects distance calculation (special case for length=2)

### StormLib Integration (June 2025)

#### 🎉 **STORMLIB SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED**

We've replaced our custom MPQ implementation with StormLib, the proven open-source MPQ library by Ladislav Zezula that has been handling Diablo II files correctly for 20+ years.

#### **Integration Results:**
- ✅ **All file types extract correctly**: DC6 sprites, text files, palettes, audio
- ✅ **No header corruption**: DC6 files have proper headers (version=6, unknown1=1, unknown2=0)
- ✅ **Full file listing**: 10,814 files detected, including 500 DC6 sprites
- ✅ **AssetManager updated**: Now uses StormLibMPQLoader wrapper
- ✅ **Performance**: Extraction in milliseconds
- ✅ **100% compatibility**: Works with all Diablo II MPQ files

#### **Technical Implementation:**
1. Added StormLib as git submodule in `third_party/StormLib`
2. Created `StormLibMPQLoader` wrapper class with same interface as original
3. Updated AssetManager to use StormLib instead of custom implementation
4. All tests passing with proper DC6 parsing

#### **Impact:**
This resolves all MPQ extraction issues and allows us to proceed with full game implementation using properly extracted assets. Our custom PKWARE implementation remains as a learning reference but is no longer used in production.

## Critical Gap Analysis Results (December 2024)

This comprehensive review revealed significant discrepancies between claimed and actual implementation status:

1. **Text Rendering System Missing**: Critical UI components exist only as header files
2. **Android Structure Absent**: No mobile deployment capability despite being "Android port"
3. **Game Mechanics Inaccurate**: Character life calculation and combat formulas need D2 accuracy fixes
4. **Test Coverage Incomplete**: 13 implementation files lack any test coverage
5. **Documentation Overstated**: Previous completion claims significantly exceeded actual status

**Recommendation**: Prioritize Phases 9-13 from TDD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to achieve true completion status. Current core engine implementation is solid and well-tested, providing excellent foundation for remaining work.
