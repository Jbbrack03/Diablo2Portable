- Extract .bin files (binary data)
- Organize by data type

#### 33.3: Palette and Graphics Data
- Extract palette files (.dat)
- Extract font files
- Extract cursor graphics
- Extract UI elements

#### 33.4: Video and Cinematics

- Handle different video formats
- Optional: Convert to mobile formats
- Organize by act/chapter

### Success Criteria
- Extracts all asset types
- Proper categorization
- No missing files
- Handles all formats

## Phase 34: Extraction Workflow Integration

### Objective
Create a unified extraction workflow that handles the complete process seamlessly.

### Tasks

#### 34.1: Unified Extraction Pipeline
- Create master extraction coordinator
- Handle all source types in one flow:
  1. Detect source type
  2. Extract to temporary location
  3. Identify game files
  4. Apply patches
  5. Organize assets
  6. Validate completeness
- Progress tracking across all steps

#### 34.2: Smart Detection and Validation
- Auto-detect all available sources
- Validate game files
- Check for completeness
- Identify missing components
- Suggest solutions for missing files

#### 34.3: Incremental Updates
- Support updating existing extraction
- Detect new patches/content
- Only extract changed files
- Maintain extraction state

#### 34.4: Platform Integration
