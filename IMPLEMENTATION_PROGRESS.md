# Implementation Progress

## Session Summary

Following TDD principles from CLAUDE.md, I've been implementing missing core functionality:

### 1. Game Loop Entity Updates (✅ COMPLETE)
- **Test**: `GameLoopUpdateTest.MonstersUpdatePositionTowardsTarget`
- **Issue Found**: Monsters had AI state updates but didn't actually move
- **Implementation**: Added movement logic to `Monster::updateAI()` when in SEEKING state
- **Result**: Monsters now move towards their targets at 5.0 units/second

### 2. Shader Compilation (✅ COMPLETE)
- **Test**: `ShaderImplementationTest.RejectsInvalidGLSL`
- **Issue Found**: ShaderManager returned valid IDs for invalid shaders
- **Implementation**: Added basic GLSL syntax validation to detect invalid shaders
- **Result**: ShaderManager now returns 0 for shaders with syntax errors

### 3. Network Socket Creation (✅ COMPLETE)
- **Test**: `NetworkManagerTest.CreatesRealNetworkSocket`
- **Issue Found**: NetworkManager created sessions but no real sockets
- **Implementation**: Added real TCP socket creation with bind() and listen() calls
- **Result**: Game sessions now have valid socket descriptors and can listen on port 6112

### 4. Network Data Transmission (✅ COMPLETE)
- **Test**: `NetworkManagerTest.TransmitsDataOverNetwork`
- **Issue Found**: GameSession had no ability to send data over network
- **Implementation**: Added sendRawData() method and byte tracking
- **Result**: Sessions can now transmit data and track bytes sent

### Critical Issues Still Remaining (from CLAUDE.md):
1. **JNI Bridge** - Tests pass but actual Android app may have issues
2. **OpenGL Rendering** - Marked as complete but may need validation
3. **Input Forwarding** - Input captured but not all connections working
4. **Audio Playback** - No actual sound implementation (despite tests passing)
5. **Network Sockets** - ✅ NOW IMPLEMENTED with real sockets!

### Next Steps:
Continue implementing missing functionality:
- Implement real audio device initialization (Oboe library for Android)
- Add actual audio playback capability
- Validate OpenGL rendering is truly functional
- Test JNI bridge with actual Android deployment

Each implementation should follow strict TDD:
1. Write ONE failing test
2. See it fail
3. Implement minimal code to pass
4. Commit immediately
5. Repeat
