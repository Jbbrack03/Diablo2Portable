# Diablo II Android Port - Checkin Report
Date: 2025-07-11

## GAPS FOUND

### 1. Documentation Inaccuracies
- **Test Count Mismatch**: Documentation claims 782 tests, actual count is 773
- **Phase Count Discrepancy**: Claims "ALL 36 PHASES COMPLETE" but Phases 37-40 exist and are not implemented
- **Incorrect Status**: Project marked as "FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND BUG-FREE" but corrective phases 37-40 were defined to address issues

### 2. Unimplemented Phases (37-40)
The following phases are defined in TDD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md but NOT completed:

**Phase 37: Documentation Accuracy and Test Validation**
- Task 37.1: Fix Test Count Discrepancies
- Task 37.2: Update Project Status Documentation  
- Task 37.3: Verify Build Instructions
- Task 37.4: Validate Feature Claims

**Phase 38: Android Build System Validation**
- Task 38.1: Fix Android SDK Configuration
- Task 38.2: Validate JNI Bridge
- Task 38.3: Test APK Generation
- Task 38.4: Device Deployment Testing

**Phase 39: Asset Integration System Repair**
- Task 39.1: Fix MPQ Placeholder Files
- Task 39.2: Implement Asset Fallback System
- Task 39.3: Create Asset Validation Tools
- Task 39.4: Test Real Game Asset Loading

**Phase 40: Production Readiness Assessment**
- Task 40.1: Performance Benchmarking
- Task 40.2: Memory Profiling
- Task 40.3: Crash Report System
- Task 40.4: Release Build Validation

### 3. MPQ File Issues
- Several critical MPQ files are placeholders (1.0MB files filled with 'X'):
  - d2data.mpq
  - d2exp.mpq
  - d2sfx.mpq
- This prevents full asset loading functionality from working

### 4. Missing Implementations
Per CLAUDE.md "What Is Actually Missing":
- MPQ Asset Loading - Integration tests failing
- Network Sockets - Uses static variables, no real networking
- Audio Playback - No actual sound implementation
- Advanced Game Features - Gameplay mechanics not fully integrated

## RECOMMENDATION
The project is NOT ready to be marked as complete. Phases 37-40 should be implemented to:
1. Fix documentation accuracy issues
2. Validate Android build system
3. Repair asset integration
4. Perform production readiness assessment

Once these phases are complete, the project can be marked as finished.
